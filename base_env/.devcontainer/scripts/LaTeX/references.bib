  abstract = {Abstract                            Oral squamous cell carcinomas unusually show distant metastasis to the lung after primary treatment, which can be difficult to differentiate from primary squamous cell carcinoma of the lung. While the location and number of tumor nodules is helpful in diagnosing cases, differential diagnosis may be difficult even with histopathological examination. Therefore, we attempted to identify molecules that can facilitate accurate differential diagnosis. First, we performed a comprehensive gene expression analysis using microarray data for OSCC-LM and LSCC, and searched for genes showing significantly different expression levels. We then identified               KRT13               ,               UPK1B               , and nuclear receptor subfamily 0, group B, member 1 (               NR0B1               ) as genes that were significantly upregulated in LSCC and quantified the expression levels of these genes by real-time quantitative RT-PCR. The expression of               KRT13               and               UPK1B               proteins were then examined by immunohistochemical staining. While OSCC-LM showed no               KRT13               and               UPK1B               expression, some tumor cells of LSCC showed               KRT13               and               UPK1B               expression in 10 of 12 cases (83.3\%). All LSCC cases were positive for at least one of these markers. Thus,               KRT13               and               UPK1B               might contribute in differentiating OSCC-LM from LSCC.},

Using a prostasphere-based label retention assay, we recently identified keratin 13 (KRT13)-enriched prostate stem cells at single-cell resolution, distinguishing them from daughter progenitors. Herein, we characterized the epithelial cell lineage hierarchy in prostaspheres using single-cell RNA-seq analysis. Keratin profiling revealed three clusters of label-retaining prostate stem cells; cluster I represents quiescent stem cells (PSCA, CD36, SPINK1, and KRT13/23/80/78/4 enriched), while clusters II and III represent active stem and bipotent progenitor cells (KRT16/17/6 enriched). Gene set enrichment analysis revealed enrichment of stem and cancer-related pathways in cluster I. In non-label-retaining daughter progenitor cells, three clusters were identified; cluster IV represents basal progenitors (KRT5/14/6/16 enriched), while clusters V and VI represent early and late-stage luminal progenitors, respectively (KRT8/18/10 enriched). Furthermore, MetaCore analysis showed enrichment of the ``cytoskeleton remodeling--keratin filaments'' pathway in cancer stem-like cells from human prostate cancer specimens. Along with common keratins (KRT13/23/80/78/4) in normal stem cells, unique keratins (KRT10/19/6C/16) were enriched in cancer stem-like cells. Clarification of these keratin profiles in human prostate stem cell lineage hierarchy and cancer stem-like cells can facilitate the identification and therapeutic targeting of prostate cancer stem-like cells.},

Loss of CK13 has been implicated in the development and progression of squamous epithelial neoplasms. To comprehensively determine CK13 expression in normal and neoplastic tissues, a tissue microarray containing 10,439 samples from 131 different tumor types and subtypes as well as 608 samples of 76 different normal tissue types was analyzed by immunohistochemistry. CK13 immunostaining was detectable in 42 (32.1\%) of the 131 tumor categories including 24 (18.3\%) tumor types with at least one strongly positive case. The highest rate of positive staining was found in various urothelial neoplasms (52.1--92.3\%) including Brenner tumor of the ovary (86.8\%) and in squamous cell carcinomas from various sites of origin (39.1--77.6\%), Warthin tumors of parotid glands (66.7\%), adenosquamous carcinomas of the cervix (33.3\%), thymomas (16.0\%), and endometroid carcinomas of the ovary (15.3\%). Twenty other epithelial or germ cell neoplasms showed -- a usually weak -- CK13 positivity in less than 15\% of the cases. In bladder cancer, reduced CK13 expression was linked to high grade and advanced stage (p\,{$<$}\,0.0001 each). In squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix, reduced CK13 immunostaining was related to high grade (p~=~0.0295) and shortened recurrence-free (p~=~0.0094) and overall survival (p~=~0.0274). In a combined analysis of 1,151 squamous cell carcinomas from 11 different sites of origin, reduced CK13 staining was linked to high grade (p~=~0.0050). Our data provide a comprehensive overview on CK13 expression in normal and neoplastic human tissues. CK13 expression predominates in urothelial neoplasms and in squamous cell carcinomas of different organs, and a loss of CK13 expression is associated with aggressive disease in these tumors.},

FXR (farnesoid X receptor/NR1H4) is a transcription factor regulated by bile acids such as CDCA (chenodeoxycholic acid). FXR protects the liver and the intestinal tract against bile acid overload; however, a functional role for FXR in the stomach has not been described. We detected FXR expression in the normal human stomach and in GC (gastric cancer). FXR mRNA and protein were also present in the human GC cell lines MKN45 and SNU5, but not in the AGS cell line. Transfection of FXR into AGS cells protected against TNF{$\alpha$} (tumour necrosis factor {$\alpha$})-induced cell damage. We identified K13 (keratin 13), an anti-apoptotic protein of desmosomes, as a novel CDCA-regulated FXR-target gene. FXR bound to a conserved regulatory element in the proximal human K13 promoter. Gastric expression of K13 mRNA was increased in an FXR-dependent manner by a chow diet enriched with 1\% (w/w) CDCA and by indomethacin (35~mg/kg of body weight intraperitoneal) in C57BL/6 mice. FXR-deficient mice were more susceptible to indomethacin-induced gastric ulceration than their WT (wild-type) littermates. These results suggest that FXR increases the resistance of human and murine gastric epithelial cells to inflammation-mediated damage and may thus participate in the development of GC.},

Previously, we found that cells derived from a nodal metastatic squamous cell carcinoma are highly proliferative and motile in vitro and tumorigenic in vivo. In the current study, we have investigated the role of vimentin in proliferation and motility. Cells derived from nodal metastasis express high levels of vimentin, which is undetectable in tumor cells derived from a synchronous primary lesion of tongue. Vimentin expression was enhanced by epidermal growth factor and transforming growth factor-{$\beta$} both independently and in combination. Use of RNA interference resulted in the generation of stable cell lines that express constitutively low levels of vimentin. RNA interference-mediated vimentin knockdown reduced cellular proliferation, migration, and invasion through a basement membrane substitute by 3-fold compared with nontargeting controls. In addition, cells with reduced vimentin reexpressed differentiation-specific keratins K13, K14, and K15 as a result of increased gene transcription as judged by quantitative PCR and promoter-reporter assays. Furthermore, cells in which vimentin expression was reduced showed a greatly decreased tumorigenic potential, as tumors developing from these cells were 70\% smaller than those from control cells. The data suggest that reversal of the mesenchymal phenotype by inhibiting vimentin expression results in reexpression of epithelial characteristics and reduced tumor aggressiveness.

The authors have studied the expression of vimentin and cytokeratins (CK) 4, 7, 8, 13, 18, 19 in normal pancreas, chronic pancreatitis, and pancreas cancer using monoclonal antibodies. Immunohistochemical assays were performed on fresh frozen tissue sections and on cultured pancreas cancer cells using the streptavidin-peroxidase method. In normal pancreas, acinar cells expressed CK 8 and 18, whereas ductal cells expressed CK 7, 8, 18, and 19. CK 4 was expressed by 5-10\% of pancreas duct cells in all specimens of normal pancreas. CK 13 was not detected in any epithelial cells of normal pancreas or pancreatitis. CK 7, 8, 18, and 19 were homogeneously expressed in all pancreas cancers, whereas CK 4 was expressed only in 5-50\% of cells in 10/16 tumors. Foci of squamous metaplasia expressed CK 13 but showed partial loss of expression of CK 7, 8, 18, and 19. Thirteen pancreas cancer cell lines examined showed homogeneous expression of CK 7, 8, 18, and 19; 2/11 lines expressed CK 4 weakly, and 6/11 expressed vimentin. CK 13 was not detected in any of the lines. These results indicate that pancreas cancer cells consistently express cytokeratin polypeptides characteristic of ductal epithelial cells and that this phenotype is retained in pancreas cancer cell lines. In addition, squamous metaplasia is associated with a coordinate change in the expression of CK polypeptides.},

Radiation is performed as an adjuvant therapy as well as anti-cancer drugs. Because cancer stem-like cells (CSCs) are considered to be radioresistant and cause recurrence and metastasis, understanding their properties is required for the development of novel therapeutic strategies. To investigate the CSC properties of pancreatic cancer cells, we used a pancreatic CSC model, degron (++) cells, which have low proteasome activity. Degron (++) cells displayed radioresistance in comparison with control cells. Using Ribonucleic acid (RNA) sequencing, we successfully identified KRT13 as a candidate gene responsible for radioresistance. Knockdown of KRT13 sensitized the degron (++) cells to radiation. Furthermore, a database search revealed that KRT13 is upregulated in pancreatic cancer cell lines and that high expression of KRT13 is associated with poorer prognosis. These results indicate that a combination therapy of KRT13 knockdown and radiation could hold therapeutic promise in pancreatic cancer.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Background               Keratins (KRTs) are intermediate filament proteins that interact with multiple regulatory proteins to initiate signaling cascades. Keratin 13 (KRT13) plays an important role in breast cancer progression and metastasis. The objective of this study is to elucidate the mechanism by which KRT13 promotes breast cancer growth and metastasis.                                         Methods               The function and mechanisms of KRT13 in breast cancer progression and metastasis were assessed by overexpression and knockdown followed by examination of altered behaviors in breast cancer cells and in xenograft tumor formation in mouse mammary fat pad. Human breast cancer specimens were examined by immunohistochemistry and multiplexed quantum dot labeling analysis to correlate KRT13 expression to breast cancer progression and metastasis.                                         Results                                KRT13-overexpressing MCF7 cells displayed increased proliferation, invasion, migration and in vivo tumor growth and metastasis to bone and lung. Conversely, KRT13 knockdown inhibited the aggressive behaviors of HCC1954 cells. At the molecular level, KRT13 directly interacted with plakoglobin (PG, {$\gamma$}-catenin) to form complexes with desmoplakin (DSP). This complex interfered with PG expression and nuclear translocation and abrogated PG-mediated suppression of c-Myc expression, while the KRT13/PG/c-Myc signaling pathway increased epithelial to mesenchymal transition and stem cell-like phenotype. KRT13 expression in 58 human breast cancer tissues was up-regulated especially at the invasive front and in metastatic specimens (12/18) (                 p                 \,{$<$}\,0.05). KRT13 up-regulation in primary breast cancer was associated with decreased overall patient survival.                                                        Conclusions               This study reveals that KRT13 promotes breast cancer cell growth and metastasis via a plakoglobin/c-Myc pathway. Our findings reveal a potential novel pathway for therapeutic targeting of breast cancer progression and metastasis.},
